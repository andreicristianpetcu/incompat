Incompat is a companion for Webcompat.com. It helps track compatibility bugs for sites that you build or use every day.

If you want to see web compatibility bugs on sites you build or use, just install this extension and it will pull data from webcompat.com and make it visible to you in the URL bar after pages load.

A web compatibility bug is a bug when a page works in one browser but not in another. It might work on a browser on desktop but have issues in the same browser on mobile.

The cause of these bugs is usually developers that use features that are not available in all browsers. Volunteers track, troubleshoot even contact the site authors and help them overcome these issues.

If you ‚ù§Ô∏è the open web, join the community and track web compatibility üêú! Thank you! üåà
